## final requirement for Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

### Source of Data

Data came from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

### Short Procedure 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Download the dataset
2. Extract all the needed datasets, Traing and Test datasets.
3. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
Merges the two datasets
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. The final dataset named as tidy.txt
